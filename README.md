# Battle Button

## Summary
Battle Button is a simple game built with plain old object-oriented Javascript, jQuery and Bootstrap. Just click the Start button to hide the button, then click around until you find it again. Use the hints to find the button with as few guesses as possible.

I hope you appreciate the object-oriented design, the responsiveness of the button size, and the simple intervention I made to prevent a window resize from throwing the whole game off.

## Three Sentences
* I'm good at imagining the scenarios that would break my code, thinking of creative product features and googling to find syntax or get unstuck. I'd like to be more fluid in my syntax so that I can code faster, and I am always thinking about how to make my code DRY-er and more self-documenting. My ideal intern project would be to work with a company that wants to use Button to further their corporate social responsiblity (CSR) program â€” by allowing users to donate to a nonprofit or take an online action.

## Why Button?
As a former digital marketer, I love that Button is helping app developers find a "win-win" by connecting their users via buttons to helpful and appropriate goods & services. It's a win for the developer because, well, money. And it's a win for users because the buttons are relevant and helpful.

I'd love to work for Button because the idea of creating an elegant hand-off from one app to another is really exciting to me. I can imagine countless interesting technical challenges related to making that experience delightful for a user. I know I would learn a lot at Button by using my skills and creativity to tackle them.
